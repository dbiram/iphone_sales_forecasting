# üìà iPhone Sales Forecasting

**Goal:** Forecast the next 8 weeks of weekly iPhone unit sales per model, incorporating:
- Historical sales
- Product lifecycle (cold start)
- Promotions / discounts
- Seasonality

This mirrors real-world retail forecasting use cases in inventory management and supply chain optimization.

## üìä Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ EDA & Problem Framing
- Weekly sales analyzed per iPhone model
- Seasonality and lifecycle effects identified
- Promotions detected as sales spikes

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Baseline Models
- Prophet and naive forecasting evaluated
- Volatile sales segments revealed baseline weaknesses

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ LightGBM Supervised Learning
- Features:
  - Lagged sales (`t-1`, `t-2`, `t-4`)
  - Rolling mean (4 weeks)
  - Promotions flag
  - Product age (weeks since launch)
  - Time encodings (week of year)
- Trained per-product and globally using LightGBM

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Based Backtesting
- Rolling-window evaluation (2019‚Äì2024)
- Forecasted next 8 weeks per window
- Evaluated using MAPE, WAPE, and RMSE

## üìä Results

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Global WAPE   |    2 %    |
| Global MAPE   | ~909 %    |
| Global RMSE   | ~793 units|

> **Note:** High MAPE explained by small-actual weeks inflating % errors. WAPE preferred for business evaluation.
